This article contains Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding **Security**.

### Q: Why should I trust Bitwarden with my passwords?

**A:** You can trust us for a few reasons:

1. Bitwarden is **open source** software. All of our source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitwarden){:target="_blank"} and is free for anyone to review. Thousands of software developers follow Bitwarden's source code projects (and you should too!).
2. Bitwarden [is **audited**]({% link _articles/security/is-bitwarden-audited.md %}) **by reputable third-party security firms** as well as independent security researchers.
3. Bitwarden **does not store your passwords**. Bitwarden stores encrypted versions of your passwords [that only you can unlock]({% link _articles/security/what-encryption-is-used.md %}). Your sensitive information is encrypted locally on your personal device before ever being sent to our cloud servers.
4. **Bitwarden has a reputation.** Bitwarden is used by millions of individuals and businesses. If we did anything questionable or risky, we'd be out of business!

Still don't trust us? You don't have to. Open source is beautiful. You can easily host the entire Bitwarden stack yourself. You control your data. Learn more [here]({% link _articles/hosting/install-on-premise.md %}).

### Q: What happens if Bitwarden gets hacked?

**A:** Bitwarden takes extreme measures to ensure that its websites, applications, and cloud servers are secure. Bitwarden uses Microsoft Azure managed services to manage server infrastructure and security, rather than doing so directly.

If for some reason Bitwarden were to get hacked and your data was exposed, your information is still protected due to [strong encryption and one-way salted hashing]({% link _articles/security/what-encryption-is-used.md %}) measures taken on your Vault data and master password.

### Q: Can Bitwarden see my passwords?

**A:** No.

Your data is fully encrypted and/or hashed before ever leaving **your** local device, so no one from the Bitwarden team can ever see, read, or reverse engineer to get to your real data. Bitwarden servers only store encrypted and hashed data. For more information about how your data is encrypted, see [Encryption]({% link _articles/security/what-encryption-is-used.md %}).

### Q: Is my master password stored locally?

**A:** No.

We do not keep the master password stored locally or in memory. Your encryption key (derived from the master password) is kept in memory only while the app is unlocked, which is required to decrypt data in your vault. When the vault is locked, this data is purged from memory.

We also reload the application's renderer process after 10 seconds of inactivity on the lock screen to make sure any managed memory addresses which have not yet been garbage collected are purged. We do our best to ensure that any data that may be in memory for the application to function is only held in memory for as long as you need it and that memory is cleaned up whenever the application is locked. We consider the application to be completely safe while in a locked state.

### Q: What do I do if I don't recognize a new device logging in?

**A:** If the IP address of a new device doesn't match any known IP addresses (home network, work network, mobile network, etc.), change your master password and make sure Two-step Login is enabled for your account. You should also Deauthorize Sessions from the **Settings** page of your Web Vault to force logout on all devices. If you think your Vault items might be compromised, you should change your passwords.

### Q: What is Bitwarden compliant with? What certifications do you have?

**A:** Bitwarden is compliant with the following policies:

- **GDPR.** Read more [here](https://bitwarden.com/privacy).
- **CCPA.** Read more [here](https://bitwarden.com/compliance).
- **HIPAA.** Read more [here](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/why-use-a-hippa-compliant-password-manager/).
- **SOC 2 Type 2.** Read more [here](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/bitwarden-achieves-soc-2-certification/).
- **SOC 3.** Read more [here](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/bitwarden-achieves-soc-2-certification/).

For more information, please visit our [Security and Compliance](https://bitwarden.com/compliance) page.

### Q: What third-party services, libraries or identifiers are used?

**A:** In the Mobile apps, Firebase Cloud Messaging (often mistaken for a tracker) is used only for push notifications related to [sync]({% link _articles/miscellaneous/vault-sync.md %}) and performs absolutely no tracking functions. Microsoft Visual Studio App Center is used for crash reporting on a range of mobile devices. In the Web Vault, Stripe and PayPal scripts are used for payment processing only on payment pages.

For those who prefer to exclude all 3rd party communication, Firebase and HockeyApp are removed completely from the F-Droid build. Additionally, Turning off push notifications on a self-hosted Bitwarden server will disable using the push relay server.

Bitwarden takes user security and privacy seriously. Bitwarden maintains secure, end-to-end encryption with zero knowledge of your encryption key. As a company focused on open source, we invite anyone to review our library implementations at any time on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitwarden).

### Q: How do I require Two-step Login for my Organization?

**A:** Use an [Enterprise Policy]({% link _articles/organizations/policies.md %}), included with an Enterprise Organization subscription. You can also enable Duo MFA integration to enforce 2FA/MFA for your Organization. For more information, see [Two-step Login via Duo]({% link _articles/two-step-login/setup-two-step-login-duo.md %}).

### Q: What are the certificate options for a self-hosted instance of Bitwarden?

**A:** See [Certificate Options]({% link _articles/hosting/certificates.md %}) for a complete list and instructions.

### Questions Regarding Specific Client Apps

### Q: What data does Bitwarden use from client applications?

**A:** Bitwarden uses Administrative Data to provide the Bitwarden Service to you. As indicated by some  **App Privacy** reports, users provide the following information on account creation:

- Your Name (*optional*).
- Your Email Address (used for Email Verification, Account Administration, and communication between you and Bitwarden).

Additionally, a **Bitwarden-generated** device-specific GUID (sometimes referred to as a *Device ID*) is assigned to your device. This GUID is used to alert you when a new device logs into your Vault.

### Q: Can you explain Electron App Security?

**A:** An often shared article suggests a flaw with Electron apps, however the referenced attack requires a user to have a compromised machine, which of course would allow a malicious attacker to compromise data on that machine. As long as you have no reason to believe the device you are using has been compromised, your data is safe.

### Q: How does Bitwarden secure Browser extensions?

Extensions are safe to use if they are developed correctly. Due to the nature of how browser extensions work there is always a chance for a bug to arise. We take extreme care and caution when we are developing our extensions and add-ons, we keep our eyes and ears out for anything going on in the industry, and we conduct security audits to keep many eyes on everything.

### Q: What is the Browser Extension asking permission for?

**A:** On installation, the Browser Extension will ask permission to access your clipboard in order to use the scheduled clipboard clear function (accessed in the **Options** menu).

When this **optional feature** is enabled, clipboard clear will clear any Bitwarden entries made by or filled on a configurable interval. Access to the clipboard allows Bitwarden to do this *without* removing a clipboard item not associated from the Bitwarden application by checking the last-copied item again the last-copied item from your Vault. Please note, this feature is **off by default**.

### Q: Why does the Browser Extension need `nativeMessaging` permission?

**A:**
Version 1.48.0 of the browser extension enables [Biometric Unlock for Browser Extensions](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/biometrics/#browser-extensions).

This permission, also known as `nativeMessaging`, is safe to accept and allows the browser extension to communicate with the Bitwarden desktop app, which is required to enabled Unlock with Biometrics.

Note that when your browser updates to this version, you may be asked to accept a new permission called "communicate with cooperating native applications" (in Chromium-based browsers), or "exchange messages with programs other than Firefox." If you don't accept this permission, the extension will remain disabled.

### Q: Is Bitwarden FIPS Compliant?

**A:** Bitwarden uses [FIPS compliant libraries and cryptography](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/what-encryption-is-used/#invoked-crypto-libraries), however the Bitwarden platform has not performed any FIPs certifications. Most FIPS installations of Bitwarden leverage the self-hosting option to make evaluations (i.e. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) easier.

### Q: Can I restrict access to Bitwarden to certain devices?

**A:** Using self-hosting, you can use custom firewall and NGINX configurations as well as VPN/VLAN access control to determine the device types and/or network layer access for your Bitwarden instance. You may also use other tools such as device-level certificates to control specific device access to the Bitwarden instance as well.
